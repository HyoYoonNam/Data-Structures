# Binary-coded decimal
**binary-coded decimal (BCD)** is a class of binary encodings of decimal numbers where each digit is represented by a fixed number of bits, usually four or eight.  
> Both **Zoned Decimal** and **Packed Decimal** formats are types of BCD because they represent decimal digits in a binary form.
